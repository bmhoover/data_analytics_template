# Data Wrangling Template

## Overview
This repository is a template for data analytics projects. It provides a structured format for storing data, scripts, notebooks, and results, making it easier to start new analytics projects with an organized layout.

## Folder Structure
This template includes the following folders:

- **data/**: Contains datasets and data dictionaries.
  - **raw/**: Stores raw, unprocessed data files.
  - **processed/**: Contains cleaned and transformed data files.
  - **dictionary/**: Stores data dictionaries explaining each dataset’s fields.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling.
  - **exploration/**: For exploratory data analysis notebooks.
  - **modeling/**: For notebooks used in building and evaluating models.
  
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preparation and analysis.

- **results/**: Stores output files, visuals, and reports.
  - **visuals/**: For plots and visualizations created during analysis.
  - **reports/**: Summary reports and insights.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository as a starting point for new data analytics projects.
2. Add your raw data files to the `data/raw/` folder.
3. Use the `notebooks/exploration/` folder for initial data exploration and `notebooks/modeling/` for model building.
4. Store final results, visuals, and reports in the `results/` folder.

## Requirements
List any software or libraries commonly needed in your analytics projects:
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Data Dictionary
Each dataset should have a corresponding data dictionary in the `data/dictionary/` folder. This dictionary should document each variable's name, type, and description. A sample data dictionary is included in this template as `sample_data_dictionary.md`.

## Change Log
All project updates and changes should be documented in `CHANGELOG.md`. This template includes a sample format for tracking changes over time.

## To-Do List
To track project tasks, use a `TODO.md` file or include a section here in the README. Here’s a sample to-do list format:

- [ ] Clean and preprocess data
- [ ] Conduct exploratory data analysis
- [ ] Develop predictive model
- [ ] Evaluate model performance
