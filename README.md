# Data Wrangling Template

## Overview
This repository is a template for my data wrangling class. It provides a structured format to store data, notebooks, and results, making it easier to start new analytics projects with an organized layout.

## Folder Structure
This template includes the following folders:

- **data/**: Contains datasets and data dictionaries.
  - **raw/**: Stores raw, unprocessed data files.
  - **processed/**: Contains cleaned and transformed data files.
  - **dictionary/**: Stores data dictionaries explaining each datasetâ€™s fields.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling.
  - **exploration/**: For exploratory data analysis notebooks.
  - **modeling/**: For notebooks used in building and evaluating models.

- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preparation and analysis.

- **results/**: Stores output files, visuals, and reports.
  - **visuals/**: For plots and visualizations created during analysis.
  - **reports/**: Summary reports and insights.

- **sample_data_dictionary.md**: A sample template for documenting datasets.

- **CHANGELOG.md**: A log of changes to track the project's evolution over time.

- **sample_notebook_template.ipynb**: A template Jupyter Notebook file with placeholder cells for common steps like importing libraries, loading data, and initial analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository as a starting point for new data analytics projects.
2. Add your raw data files to the `data/raw/` folder.
3. Use the `notebooks/exploration/` folder for initial data exploration and the `notebooks/modeling/` folder for building models.
4. Store final results, visuals, and reports in the `results/` folder.

## Requirements
List any software or libraries commonly needed in your analytics projects, for example:
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
