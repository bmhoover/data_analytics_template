# Notebooks Folder

## Purpose
The `notebooks` folder is used to store Jupyter notebooks for various stages of data analysis, including exploration, visualization, and modeling.

## Contents
- **exploration/**: Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns, distributions, and relationships.
- **modeling/**: Notebooks for building and evaluating machine learning models or performing statistical analysis.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use the `exploration/` sub-folder for notebooks focused on understanding the data and performing initial analysis.
- Use the `modeling/` sub-folder for notebooks that contain the steps to build, train, and evaluate models.
- Ensure each notebook is well-documented with comments and Markdown cells explaining the purpose of each step.
