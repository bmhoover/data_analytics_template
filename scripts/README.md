# Scripts Folder

## Purpose
The `scripts` folder contains Python scripts for data processing, cleaning, and analysis. These scripts are intended to perform tasks that are reused across different parts of the project.

## Contents
- **data_prep.py**: Example script for data preparation tasks like cleaning, transforming, and filtering data.
- **analysis.py**: Example script for analysis or modeling steps that may be used across multiple notebooks.

## Usage Guidelines
- Keep scripts modular and reusable, with functions that can be easily called from different notebooks or other scripts.
- Avoid hardcoding file paths or specific parameters in scripts. Instead, use variables or configuration files for better flexibility.
- Document each function within the script to explain its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
