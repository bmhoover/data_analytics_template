# Results Folder

## Purpose
The `results` folder is used to store output files generated from the analysis. This includes plots, charts, and summary reports that provide insights based on the data.

## Contents
- **visuals/**: Contains plots, charts, and other visualizations created during analysis.
- **reports/**: Contains summary reports or presentations that document key findings and conclusions from the analysis.

## Usage Guidelines
- Store visualizations in the `visuals/` folder, especially if they will be referenced in reports or presentations.
- Use the `reports/` folder for any document summarizing insights or results, such as PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, or text summaries.
- Ensure all output files are named clearly to indicate their contents and purpose (e.g., `sales_trend_plot.png` or `final_analysis_report.pdf`).
